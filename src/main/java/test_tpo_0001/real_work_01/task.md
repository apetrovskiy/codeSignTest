Question Title
* Background
An importation function in any company that builds software is validating that both business and technical requirements specified as inputs for engineering have been correctly implemented and that the main use case is achieved, without breaking or leaving gaps in related use cases. This function is usually named “acceptance” and is usually performed by an agile product owner, a product manager, a technical team lead, a delivery manager, or, in some cases, even by a hands-on software engineering manager. While acceptance is different from the exhaustive testing that quality assurance engineers usually perform, it does not imply avoiding raising any straight-forward issues that QA for some reason missed.
This assessment evaluates one’s ability to do such validations, by taking some sample inputs that were provided to an engineering team and asking you to validate if the deliverables fulfill the requirements.

Sample Requirements & Deliverables
The following input was provided to the UX Design team: Use Case - Crossover - Company Pages
The following output was provided by the UX Design team: Crossover Company Pages - Design
Note: if a design was not provided for a screen, consider the changes are simple enough they don’t require a design
The Use Case, Design and following two tasks were provided to engineering: Front-end Integration - Company Pages
Engineering did the implementation and returned the following deliverables:

Company Detail Page, e.g: https://accepting-assesment.d3e0gznmfxfboy.amplifyapp.com/companies/crossover

Submit
A list of all the issues you have found with the implementation vs the requirements (Use Case, Design, Engineering Tasks).

You will be evaluated on how many issues you find, on the following criteria (in priority order):
Identifying functional issues, e.g.
Use case requirements are not implemented
Inputs missing vs use case or design
The output is broken for certain types of inputs
Identifying technical (code/architecture) requirement gaps, e.g.
A clearly specified technical requirement was not met
A query is not paged / more data is brought in than actually required
Identifying design misalignments, e.g.
Misplaced inputs or outputs
UI not behaving as normally expected
Obvious spacing or font differences from design
