Attention: this assessment is proctored
If this were an in-person assessment process, you’d be completing all of the hiring assessments and interviews on-site using only the provided materials. To replicate that authenticity online, we’ve chosen to proctor this assessment to prevent fraud.

You will be redirected our partner, ProctorEdu, where you will be able to take a proctored assessment session.

Verify that your webcam, microphone and screen sharing are properly working on the meeting program.
