<div>1. (-) hard-coded ConsoleLogger - what if we'll need in the future a logger of another type?<br>2. (+) provider injection<br>3. (+-) I would separate SQL code and Java code by moving the INSERT statement into a constant class or a repository class (but I consider this optional depending on how many such classes we have in the solution)<br>4. (-) Even simple, hard-coded values like 1, 2, 3 are not of good style, prefer using constants like ID_FIELD, ID_FIELD_NUMBER, enum for fields or whatever.<br>5. (-) I would extract the preparation of statement to a smaller method and used the result to execute (like this: getPreparedStatement(car).execute(); where the getPreparedStatement method includes lines 13-19)<br>6. (-) further I would separate getting connection from preparing the statement like this (maybe, it's overkill depending on the situation):<br>private Connection getConnection() {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; try {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return dbConnectionProvider.getConnection();<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; catch (...) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // some logging about the conneciton failure<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; connection.close();<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>}<br><br>7. (-) there is poor exception handling in the catch statement<br>8. (-) logging is unstructures and says nothing about the situation<br>9. (-) I would sooner use the finally part for closing statement and connection, or both - the try and the finally statements<br>try {<br>......<br>getPreparedStatement(car).execute();<br>// statement.close();<br>// connection.close();<br>}<br>catch (...) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; // some logging about statement<br>}<br>finally {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; statement.close();<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; // there is no connection object now after item 6 connection.close();<br>}<br>10. (+-) concurrency - waht about using a connection pool<br><br></div>
