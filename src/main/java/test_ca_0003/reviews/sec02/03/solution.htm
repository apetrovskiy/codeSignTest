<div>I would use time measurement to understand better what time a suspicious report is executed.<br>Like calculation (check date - start date) and if this time is greater that some treshold, I would interrupt&nbsp;execution of the report.<br>Also, there's a potential buggy place: if report execution depends on enumeration of reports, there's some chance that&nbsp; scheduled reports won't start.<br>So, better implementation should start scheduled reports while cleanup component seeks for reports in inconsistent state that are being run long time.<br></div>
