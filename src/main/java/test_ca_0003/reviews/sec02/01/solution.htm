<div>The Maintenance team created<br>1) a new method in repository to retrieve a report by its run type and status<br>2) now the report scheduler depends on "inconsistentStateScheduleCleanup" to ensure that before each run there's no reports in the inconsistent state<br>3) this component (the cleanup) enumerates reports in the STARTED state, set their state to CANCELLED and add a description saying that the report(s) were cancelled by the server (to be honest, the description seems not to be good enough and could be more explanatory).<br></div>
