Digesting a P2 Specification
Crossover TPMs spend significant time reading product architectural documents and higher-level technical specifications (we call them P2s) that establish guardrails for architectural design patterns to follow. A great TPM is able to rapidly piece together a cohesive understanding of what the product does and how the proposed solution works.

In this assessment, we provide you with a real P2 spec produced by one of our senior TPMs and ask you to demonstrate your ability to understand and identify the most important technical decisions that shape the product architecture and to summarize the solution highlighting important facts about the design. The spec describes how to rebuild an existing product on AWS and it is unlikely that you will be familiar with all of the technology discussed, but we picked the product because it is simple to relate to.
