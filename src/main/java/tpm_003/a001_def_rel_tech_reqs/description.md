Define Release Technical Requirements
Assesses the ability to synthesize an architectural design document into a list of clearly mapped design decisions/requirements given a release breakdown. The assessment measures the candidate's ability to learn a new product/technology, understand the overall architectural design, and rationalize how it should be implemented in releases.
About This Assessment:
The timed-assessment is broken into two parts with increasing difficulty:

Part I - Mapping Technical Decisions to Releases: Map a set of design decisions to the relevant release(s) and explain your rationale
Part II - Uncovering Important Decisions: Uncover important decisions/requirements that are not explicitly spelled out in the design document and map them to the relevant release(s)
Important Readings

Before you begin this timed-assessment, we recommend you:
Familiarize yourself with our view on product architecture and important technical decisions
Read this sample solution that showcases how to solve this exercise for a different product
Familiarize yourself with the following AWS technologies: SNS, SQS, AWS Fargate, AWS SFTP
