Write a Knowledge Base Article - Level 1


Overview:

Our Knowledge Bases (KBs) house the entire body of high-quality, written knowledge about our software products, how to support the customers using them, and how to fix them when something goes wrong. The Product Knowledge Curator (PKC) role is the front line owner of the content in the KB, making sure we have the right knowledge available to our customers and our support agents, easily found when needed. Each article in the KB should enable the reader to solve a particular problem or learn about a particular aspect of the product, with no further assistance required. 

In this assignment, you’ll get the chance to show us your skills by writing three KB articles for our Level 1 Support team, focused on product installation, configuration, and usage. Your inputs will be real support tickets and KB articles - that’s why we call it a Real Work Assignment. 

Inputs:

    Level 1 support ticket(s), with a customer’s report of a problem and the Level 1 Support Agent’s solution.
    We’ll give you relevant KB articles, if they exist. If they do not exist, your job will be to write one from scratch.
    You may Google (or otherwise) search for additional information if you feel the need. The exercises are designed to be self-contained, so you shouldn’t need anything beyond simple background information, like what an acronym stands for. In other words, you will not need to teach yourself a new coding language in the next hour. 


Grading Criteria: 

Check your work against these criteria before you submit, to make sure you’re sending us your best work. We think a great KB article (like this example) includes: 

    A clear description of the problem (with root cause) or key concept.
    Step-by-step instructions for fixing or using the specific aspect of the software product. Use the information we provide to validate that the agent’s solution is correct before you write it into your article. Part of the PKC’s job is to correct any mistakes in a support agent’s solution before adding it to the Knowledge Base. 
    Relevant examples and screenshots illustrating how to execute the instructions.
    Include Keywords and search terms in the article, so it can be indexed and searched by agents, customers, and our automated AnswerBot (the AnswerBot searches the first 75 words of each KB article).

* Q1: Update an incomplete KB article

In this exercise, the L1 agent attempted to use an existing KB article to answer a customer’s question, but had to do further work to develop the final solution.
