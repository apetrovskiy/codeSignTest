About This Assessment:
Take the Criteria Cognitive Aptitude Test
One of the things that everyone that works with Crossover loves is how smart all of their colleagues are. When you work exclusively with peers that have strong problem solving, language and critical thinking skills, you are able to have higher bandwidth conversations and collaborate more efficiently.

The Criteria Cognitive Aptitude Test (CCAT) assesses each of these skills in a timed, 15-minute multiple-choice test.

Some important things you should note:

Only pen & paper are allowed. Calculators, internet search, translation tools, and other assistance are prohibited.
Once you begin the assessment, spend the entire 15 minutes in the CCAT browser tab. Navigating away from the browser will lead to automatic disqualification
If you are on a mobile device, we recommend you switch to a computer before beginning, as on smaller mobile devices you can't always see the full question. Please use Chrome, Firefox or Safari - other browsers are known to have issues with either loading the test or recording test results.
Ensure that you have a stable internet connection before beginning. As this is a timed assessment, there is no way to pause and resume.
Pay attention to the timer and answer as many questions as you can. There is no penalty for incorrect answers.
Finally, we are sad to say that we have had many applicants attempt to cheat on this assessment. Most people donâ€™t cheat, but the ones who do make it a little more difficult for everyone. To solve this problem, applicants who receive offers to join Crossover will have to achieve the same score on a proctored CCAT assessment after they join.
