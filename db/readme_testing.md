Test Instructions

Hi,

Thanks for taking the SQL assignment.
In this test, you will have both multiple-choice questions as well as SQL coding tests.
Here are some important notes on coding tests:

    you will use a web IDE that may not be as powerful as your day to day one, but we trust it is sufficient to get the job done
    each test is validated through automated tests and you what the tests you passed or failed and what the input was in the bottom tool window
    while the database engine being used is MySQL, questions practically require knowledge of ANSII SQL

Note that the test is time-constrained.
Feel free to choose how much time you want to spend on a harder problem or harder test instead of moving to a different one.
You can always come back to a test later if you have time.

Good luck!
